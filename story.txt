Hi Amjad[n], I am writing to you, the super hero inside me. I want to know why are you hiding?
Do not underestimate yourself. You already can speak Japanese[n] fluently. You also can code[v] without asking help from anyone.
You are smart[a]. You can be a/an great[a] engineer[n] with a little effort. Go out and shine out there!.
